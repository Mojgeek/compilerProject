# DFA PDA Compiler

This program demonstrates how a compiler uses a deterministic finite 
automaton for lexical analysis and a push-down automaton for parsing.
The program determines whether a text conforms to the production 
rules of a context-free grammar.

## Installing and Executing

The program was written in Visual Studio. Visual Studio solution and project
files are included in the repository.
